This is the README file for directory prac1/Java.

This directory holds example Java code for an echo client (DgEchoClient.java)
and server (DgEchoServer.java).

The echo client reads lines from stdin, writes them to a communications
socket, then reads the socket and writes the returned message to stdout.
The server reads a socket, changes the first character, and writes it back
to the program which called it.  The reason for changing the first character
is so you can make sure you're not calling the Unix system echo server.

Both client and server use udp - the Internet connectionless datagram
service.  Both client and server can be compiled using 'javac' - for
example, to compile the client:
	javac DgEchoClient.java

Once you have compiled the echo programs, use them by:

  First start the server in one window:
    DgEchoServer -p <your port number>

  Then start your client:
    DgEchoClient -h <host machine> -p <your port number>

	NOTE: You probably will need to invoke these commands using the JVM
		"java".  For example, you would start the server:

			java DgEchoServer -p <Your port number>

  The host machine is the machine your client is running on - probably
  rose or lucy.

  Test them by typing whatever you want to - the first character of
  each line should be changed, but the rest should be what you typed.

  The client will terminate on end of file (control-d from stdin).

  Be sure to terminate the server when you've finished by typing
  control-c.  Or, if you're running the server in the background (using
  '&'), be sure to terminate the server when you've finished by using the
  Unix kill command - find the process id number using the ps command
  then type:  kill pid#
